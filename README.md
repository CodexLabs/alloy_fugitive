Cucumber Testing for Titanium (testing alloy fugitive)
======================================================

## IMPORTANT: THIS IS FOR ALLOY ONLY. If you need Titanium classic Cucumber testing then please help me or wait until the node package is out.
## THESE BASH FILES WILL ERASE YOUR Resources DIRECTORY!!!!!!!!!
## THIS IS FINE FOR ALLOY, BUT CLEARLY NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR TITANIUM CLASSIC.

It is actually here. 

## Background


This is a fork of Aaron Saunders alloy_fugitive, which is in turn an Alloy port of TiBounty Hunter

Regardless, What makes this version special is that I have wrapped Calabash-ios with two bash scripts to bring you Cucumber testing with Alloy.


## Setup


Calabash-ios depends on ruby.
That said you will need to run these commands:

`gem install calabash --no-ri --no-rdoc`

Next you will want to run

`./run.sh`

When you are asked what scheme you want to copy, just press enter

next run

`./ticucumber.sh`

Watch in amazement as it just works.

One minor note: I checked in a .ruby-version file set to 1.9.3-p448 because calabash doesn't work 100% right with ruby 2.0.
Also if you only have ruby 1.8 then seriously, upgrade. In fact, I am not even sure **HOW** you even have such an outdated version of ruby.
Deleting .ruby-version shouldn't be a problem. That said, my claim is that this test harness works with that version of ruby.


## two failing steps

Yes I am aware that the two steps that reference map fail. I did that intentionally. I am writing the blog post up. the next push will fix it.
